# About

## What it does
Move.it is a solution based on the pomodoro technique. The tool provides a gamified experience to guide the user to keep good habits.

## The goal
This project comes from the [Rocketseat](https://github.com/rocketseat)'s Next Level Week #4, an event to learn more about the best technologies and dive deeper into them. My chosen track is about React.JS and its related tools. After this project, I'll be able to developer more powerful solutions with these techs.
